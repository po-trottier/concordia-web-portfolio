### Important Information

The SQLite database is being tracked for the simple reason that no setup process was written for this application and a default user is therefore needed to access the administrator area.

The default user credentials are as follows:
 - Email: `test@test.com`
 - Password: `test`

There are also test posts and messages as well as an extra user in the database to showcase the general structure of the data stored.

### Get Started

1) Install any version of `Python 3`
1) Make sure `pip` is installed
1) Install `pipenv` using `pip install pipenv` (if you are on Linux or macOS run the command as `sudo`)
1) Open a terminal/command-prompt window in the project folder
1) Run `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment shell
1) Run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies
1) Rename `config_DEMO.py` to `config.py` and change the API key values
1) Start the server with the `python app.py` command
